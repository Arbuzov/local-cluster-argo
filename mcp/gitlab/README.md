# mcp-gitlab

GitLab MCP server ([iwakitakuma/gitlab-mcp](https://hub.docker.com/r/iwakitakuma/gitlab-mcp))
at `/mcp/gitlab`, talking to the corp GitLab at `gitlab.asatnet.net`.

History: this service was originally deployed by a hand-created Argo CD
Application (chart `mcp-gitlab` 0.3.1) that was later deleted without its
finalizer, leaving the Deployment/Service/Ingress orphaned in the cluster.
This Application re-adopts those resources (same names and selectors) and
moves the GitLab token out of plain pod env into a Secret.

## VPN sidecar + hostAliases

GitLab lives behind the corp VPN, so the pod runs the same OpenConnect
sidecar as the confluence app (`mcp/atlassian/application-confluence.yaml`),
reusing the shared `mcp-atlassian-vpn-credentials` Secret.

Unlike `*.spacebridge.com` names, `gitlab.asatnet.net` exists **only in corp
DNS** (DCMASTER.asatnet.net, 192.168.30.21), which neither cluster DNS nor
the sidecar's resolver can reach — the chart's `hostAliases` value pins it
to 192.168.8.156 (`zeus-1.asatnet.net`) in `/etc/hosts` instead. If GitLab
moves hosts, update that IP.

> UDP/53 to public resolvers gets through) — that kept both this and the
> confluence MCP dead until the sidecars were pointed at asa1. The other
> groups are no help for a sidecar: `DUO` needs MFA + client cert (what
> AnyConnect on the workstation uses), `VPN_LOCAL` rejects these
> credentials, `VPN_RADIUS` wants a client certificate.

## Required out-of-band secrets

Two are shared with the atlassian apps (`mcp-atlassian-vpn-credentials`,
`mcp-basic-auth` — see `mcp/atlassian/README.md`). One is specific to this
app:

```sh
# GitLab personal access token (api scope)
kubectl -n mcp create secret generic mcp-gitlab-credentials \
  --from-literal=GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN='<your-gitlab-pat>'
```
